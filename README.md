# 🏃 The World's Greatest Parkour Lord Becomes Commoner

This is a Unity game where you play as a character doing first-person parkour in a cartoonish city. The goal of the game is to collect purple cubes scattered throughout the city while using your parkour skills to navigate through the obstacles.

The character has a double jump and a dash ability, but both are limited by a stamina bar that refills over time. You'll need to manage your stamina well to complete the challenging parkour courses.
